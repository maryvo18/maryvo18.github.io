# Why should we help our students?
[//]: # (I'd keep working on this title)
Our students are the _future_, and our students are the _now_. *If we do not help students in the next generation now, what will their future look like?* It is our responsibility to make the future better for them *, in order to make the future better for society, because they will make the society* **so that they can make the future better for the generations after them**. Every day, younger generations complain about the older generations not helping *the younger generations* as much as they should have. If we do not take the stand now to help the younger generations *than us*, we will not be able to make any change in the world or in society.

It all starts with literacy.

In a [Collegiate Times article](http://www.collegiatetimes.com/news/new_river_valley/scrabbling-for-higher-literacy-rates/article_1c2d5c05-2d59-568b-ad13-b646d9c5e63d.html) from October 18, 2011 *of* **about** local literacy in the Blacksburg community, news staff writer, Jenn Bates, stated that “illiteracy elicits dependency.” The idea of creating more dependency furthers the point that if the younger generations do not learn and understand the importance of literacy and learning, they will not be able to depend on themselves. That article also states that nearly 10 percent of adults in Montgomery County, Virginia, are functionally illiterate, coinciding with the 12 percent of adults across the state of Virginia and 14 percent of adults across the nation being illiterate, according to *date* **data** from the National Center for Education Statistics. The numbers from the surveys clearly show *there is* a missing link in the lives of many of our local students. This missing link is that of reading: reading to children, having children read to us, and encouraging reading everywhere.

More research in a September 6, 2013 (updated in 2014) [Huffington Post article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/06/illiteracy-rate_n_3880355.html) states 32 million (14 percent) adults in the United States cannot read, while another 21 percent of the adult population cannot read above a fifth grade reading level. What does this say about our society? What does this say about our encouragement and importance of education?

On an international level, the [UNESCO Institute for Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_literacy_rate) finds the worldwide literacy rate to be 86.3 percent, which means 13.7 percent of people over the age of fifteen around the world cannot read. These statistics may seem like something we cannot change, but if we do not start the change, _how will we ever see one?_ No, it will not be immediate, but there is not a better time to start than **now**.

[//]: # (Also, if developed nations are 99.2% literate but the U.S. is 86% literate, what does that say about the U.S.?)
The developed nations' (including the United States) literacy rate worldwide was approximately 99.2% in 2013, so how is the overall literacy rate so much lower? Developing countries may not have the opportunities that we do in developed countries, so shouldn’t we do our part to take part in the opportunities to become literate?

Literacy is something that is also sometimes taken for granted. As literate adults, we may see it as something that everyone obviously understands as being important, but we do not realize how many adults do not know the importance and are creating a trickle-down effect of illiterate people in the local communities, country, and even worldwide.

It is up to the current generations to get the future generations involved in the wanting to learn and read. It is our time _now_ to make the change for their future.

_Make the difference. Be the impact. The time is now_.
